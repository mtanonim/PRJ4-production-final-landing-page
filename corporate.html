                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #0093F5;"></span>
                  #0093F5
                  <em>This light blue was used for navbar and footer to tie the whole page together, establishing it's borders in gentle way. This blue stands for sophistication and reliability.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #00406B;"></span>
                  #00406B
                  <em>This dark blue was used mainly for fonts - it is dark to create some contrast with the background and "highlight" information. This blue stands for corporate and high quality</em>
                </li>

                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FEF8A6;"></span>

                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FF91F9;"></span>
                  #FF91F9
                  <em>This hot pink was used for fonts - again trying to create some contast and make headers pop. This pink stands for sincerity and is flirty.</em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="font-weight-bold">Font choices</li>
            <li><p><strong>lust-serif</strong> -> used for main headers and navbar. We used a serif font to make it more playfull fitting our brand, 
                    most of the time complimenting contrast colors.
                </p></li>
            <li><p><strong>lust-dione-fine</strong> -> used for the brand name, differentiating a bit from other text. Close to previous font, but san serif, 
                    making it fell more professional and sophisticated, while still being on brand with the playful fell. 
                 </p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Raleway</strong> -> used for normal text and announcment, as it is easily readable, also thanks to the fact of being san serif. Used for plain text
                  </p></li>                  
           
            <li class="font-weight-bold">User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>Navigation bar</strong> -> used for a coherant navigation on top of the page. Also includes a dropdown menu for more options, while maitaining its simplicity.</li>
            <li><strong>Carousel</strong> -> used an owlcarousel which adds more features like auto scroll, hover pause and dynamic number of items. Used for rating and team presentation to make it more dynamic and engaging</li>
            <li><strong>Links</strong> -> used link internal on the page linking to other parts of the code/pages of the website and externaly to our social media, making eeverything more accesible.</li>
            <li><strong>Footer</strong> -> used on the bottom the page for some navigation to our social media, top of the page and copyright</li>
            <li><strong>Video container/iframe</strong> -> used on our landing/idex page to grab immediate attention, simply showing what our service is about. It has a transparent div overlaying it making it impossible to click.</li>
            <li><strong>Divs</strong> -> using divs which utilize flexbox to structure the page, making it responsive. Also overlaying the video as mentioned before.</li>
            <li><strong>Buttons</strong> -> using buttons which uses link to direct to content (mostly ouside of the page)</li>
            <li class="font-weight-bold">The structure of the navigation and content (e.g. how content units are distributed across pages)</li>
            <li><p> The whole page is structured with repetetive navbars and footers to make the controls same and not confusing. The navbar has 4 main
                    part, making it not overwhealming, when looking for something quickly. Other parts of the of the body use flexbox to be responsive.
                    Each part has some sort of visual design = picture, video or carousel with pictures to grab the attention of the user. This is complimented
                    by contrasting colors in headers. Links provide aditional navigation through the site, while also providing redirection to external content 
                    which is relevant to the brand/product.                 
                </p>

            <li>Please relate these elements to other units, for example:
              <ul>
                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>values and personality of the brand</strong>? Colors and visuals combined align with the values and personality of the brand</li>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Your testing goal</strong> -> The goal of the testing in overall is to find out what could be improved and if it is clear and easy to find everything. We would also like to get to know what people think of the design, if it is aesthetically pleasing look at, while also matching our brands vision and values. <br><br></li>
            <li><strong>Your testing methods which includes information about:</strong>,
              <ul>
                <li><strong>The test&rsquo;s participants (number, match with target audience, etc.)</strong> -> We asked four different middle-aged singles to test our website. Three of them were women and one of them was a man.<br><br></li> 
                <li><strong>The test&rsquo;s setting(which material is used, is it done remotely, on campus, at home, etc.)</strong>  -> The testing was done in real life, and we showed the website to all of the participants on a laptop. Beforehand we thought of a few questions and tasks that they could fulfill to get to know their honest opinion. <br><br></li>
                <li><strong>The test&rsquo;s protocol (what instructions are given, how it is recorded, etc.)</strong> -> We used audio recording to capture the participants opinion. This way we can listen to it again afterwards and re-evaluate what they said. To start of the testing the participants were asked to just scroll through the website to get their first impression.
                    Afterwards we asked them to find the corporate page and look for the ratings of our product. The participants were also asked what they think of the design choices and whether they fit with our brand and its vision and values. To finish off we asked them what improvements could be made and which parts of the website they liked. <br><br></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Your testing results, which includes information about:  </strong>
              <ul>
                <li><p>
                      Issues that the participants found on our website were that multiple participants stated that the caption on the video on the homepage was not suitable for our service. Also because of this and the video they did not immediately know what our brand was about and thought it was only meant for travelling. Furthermore, several people also said that the many different colors make the website look cheap. If we would change the color 
                      of the headings, it would look more coherent. Another tip was to make the text on the right in the footer smaller and the icons of the social media bigger to make it more visible. Lastly, one participant had difficulties finding the corporate page, but this was mainly because she did not understand what it was.

                      Good aspects about our website were that the participants like the movements on the website (the video on the homepage and the carousels). They also thought that the font fit our brand since it looked playful and different than the fonts most websites use. Additionally, the participants liked the design choices we made in terms of the easy to navigate, nav bar at the top and the rest of the layout, including the pictures and 
                      shapes and the ability to click on the social media posts and be redirected to the Journeymate Instagram page.

                </li>
                <li><p>
                      According to this feedback we could make a few improvements to the website. We changed the original caption on the video from the home page from ‘Exploring the world’ to ‘Connecting people is our passion’. There are also some different pictures added to the product and home page. The size of the social media icons in the footer are also changed to make them more visible and easier to click on. The word ‘Strategy’ in the nav bar 
                      is also changed to ‘Corporate’ to make it easier to understand. Some other changes that would be implemented if it would not be too complex would be to change the background color to white, but since this would require use to change all of the classes this was not possible anymore. </p>

          <h4 id="limitations" class="mt-2 font-weight-bold">Limitations</h4>
          <p>Limitations I have found on the website:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Video on the main page does not play on a phone/tablet as youtube autoplay is dissabled on those devices -> possibly a javascript could be used to overcome this limitation. It would click on the location of the video after loading the page and playing the video?</li>
            <li>Video also shows the title of the video on initial load for small time frame.</li>
            <li>Video quality depends on the connection, as it is a youtube video</li>
            <li>Not all the testing was done with our target audience. I understand that it is important for them to test the website, but unfortenately that was not possible thatnks to the limitation of time and humane resources.</li>
            <li>The colors could be sometimes too overwhealming for some people, also not fully accurately representing our values.</li>
            <li>Pictures could be compressed to make the loading times faster</li>
            <li>Form for email submission work even without inputting an email - would be nice to have an error message </li>
          </ul>
          <h4 id="purpose" class="mt-2 font-weight-bold">Purpose of the website</h4>
          <p>Purpose of this website is prelaunch website for our product</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p> Purpose of this website is prelaunch website for our product -> this is mainly true about the product page of the whole website. Rest 
                    is raise brand awarness. We felt that prelauch website would be better suited for our product, as founding tiers for
                    crowdfunding website do no really work for us as we have a service, not a product.

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5 font-weight-bold">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2 font-weight-bold">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>We are a company that would like to connect people that are between 35-50 years old that are
              single. Our goal is to connect people who have the same interests and the same intention. We will
              achieve this by providing group activities, which the singles can sign up for. They will sign up for
              the activities they are interested in. By using batches, singles can sign up for activities with
              people who have the same intention. There are two different badges; single ready to mingle or
              single not ready to mingle. This allows people who feel alone but are not looking for a relationship
              to still build a friendship with new people.
            </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4 font-weight-bold">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>In the first week of posting on Instagram, we almost reached all our reach objectives, however, the
              likes and comments (engagement) objectives weren't reached. We saw an upward trend with the
              likes, but there were only two comments on the review post. So, people didn't feel encouraged to
              say something under our posts. This could be because, for example, we didn't ask in every post a
              question. <br><br>
              In the second week of posting on Instagram, we saw a downward trend with the account reach; it
              went from 54 reached accounts to 35 reached accounts. This could be because the last post
              was posted on a Wednesday at 3.35 PM, so maybe people are still working and thus are not using
              social media. <br><br>
              In the third week of posting on Instagram, we saw an upward trend with reached accounts, the
              likes differ between 6 and 4. The video had 4 likes and the other two posts had 6 likes. We are
              using between five and six hashtags per post. In addition, we always add a location and for the
              reels, we also added three topics, so people that are looking for something specific can also find
              our reel. So, our expectation was that we would reach more accounts and that more people
              would like our posts.  <br><br>
              In the fourth week of posting on Instagram, we had a stable reach of around 30 accounts per
              post. So, our content is not going viral, but the likes and reach are stable, so that could also be a
              good thing. The people that are following us, like our content.  <br><br>
              The post that reached the most accounts on Instagram was a dating tip about remembering
              someone's name during the first 'date'. 8 impressions were from hashtags, we reached 54
              accounts with this post, and 13 accounts were not following us. The Hashtags we used for this
              post were: #newrelationship #connectioniseverything #namingnames #newname.  <br><br>
              The post that reached the most accounts on Facebook was the 'love like animals post'. This post
              had a reach of 96 accounts and was by far the post with the most reach. Almost all other posts
              had a reach between 0-16 accounts. This is maybe because we don't have any followers via
              Facebook, so all the reach has to come from the hashtags.
          </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4 font-weight-bold">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>For the planning, it was difficult to remember to post something. So, what we did, we made all the
              posts one week before and then we scheduled the post a day before or the same day it needed
              to be posted. This helped us post more consistently. However, sometimes we also forgot to
              schedule a post, so we learned to make all the posts two weeks in advance and then schedule all
              the posts already that day for all the other days, so we won't forget to post. In this way, the posts
              will be more consistent and people can trust you more as a brand. However for Facebook was it
              more difficult to schedule posts, and we immediately saw in the planning of Facebook that we
              didn't post consistently. Because of this we sometimes posted multiple posts per day or didn't
              post anything for four days straight. Of course, this will result in less engagement and less reach.
              Which we also saw back in the statistics. So, in the future, we will buy a tool that can schedule
              posts for us on both Instagram and Facebook. <br><br>
              For future execution, we would make videos with people who have made use of JourneyMate. In
              this way, people between 35-50 years old can actually see that it is real. In addition, we would ask
              more questions, and do giveaways, so more people will share and comment. In this way, we will
              have more engagement and we will have higher brand awareness. We will even invite influencers
              who are single to use our service and post that on their socials, to create a bigger reach

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2 font-weight-bold">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Write a reflection on the choices made in creating choosing the trademark, including an analysis of the existing alternatives.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>We have enhanced our trademark throughout the project based on the problem and solution interviews and our own input. At the start of the project were thinking of using an app, 
                    but we decided to do a platform-pivot and use a website instead, because it is more accessible for all devices.  
                    According to research middle-aged singles often use LinkedIn so this was on our list for platforms that we could use for our promotion. We soon found out that it is not the most compatible platform for our brand.  
                    At first, the idea for our concept was to just create a service that provides group activities. Later on, this changed to a group activity service focused on helping people find a partner or new friend. We 
                    did this because, in our problem interviews, we found out that the majority of middle-aged singles wants to be busy by doing activities to not feel alone and would like to find a partner in a situation that does not feel forced like normal dating apps do.  
                    In our problem interviews we also uncovered that, when using dating apps, middle-aged singles often come across the problem that people have different intentions than they do. Because of their age many people are in different stages of their lives, some have children, 
                    Furthermore, due to a suggestion from a solution interview, we have decided to incorporate the part of everyone meeting and getting to know each other by doing short ‘quests’.  
                    Moreover, we decided to do a business architecture pivot. The initial idea for the revenue model was for people to pay per activity. This is still something we would like to do, but there is an extra option to pay for a monthly subscription that 
                    also gives people early access to sign up for activities. 
                </p></li>
            <li><p>There are already many existing dating apps, such as Tinder, Bumble, Grinder, etc. We wanted to be different with our brand since not all middle-aged singles are looking for a partner and we mainly wanted to solve the loneliness. 
                    Additionally, we uncovered in our problem interviews that many people felt like the existing dating apps feel forced and they do not like that. There are also already many group activity organizations. However, often these are for organized 
                    vacations and are not specifically designed to meet a partner or new friend.     
                </p></li>
            <li><p>Overall, we think we have done a good job improving our brand and service. We tried to make it as original as possible and listened to what our interviewees had to say on how we could improve. All of them liked our idea and said that they would use Journeymate. 
                    The two main criteria for Journeymate to become a success is the willingness of people to join on our activities and the willingness to find a new partner or friend.      
                </p></li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4 class="mt-2 font-weight-bold">Explanation final canvas</h4>
          <p class="font-italic font-weight-bold"> Problem  </p>
          <p>These problems were all uncovered in our problem interviews. Our interviewees said that they tried to keep themselves busy so that they would not feel so lonely. And that it was difficult to find someone at their age who had the same intentions as they did, since many people already have children or still really want to have children for example.</p> 
          <p>Right now, these problems are mostly already separately solved by ‘normal’ dating apps and activity sign ups. These problems were all uncovered in our problem interviews. Our interviewees said that they tried to keep themselves busy so that they would not feel so lonely. And that it was difficult to find people with the same intentions.</p> 
          <p class="font-italic font-weight-bold"> Solution  </p>
          <p>People can sign up for group activities to feel less lonely. Also, they sign up for an activity instead of a specific person. This solves their problem that they think dating apps feel forced because this way it is much more natural to meet someone, but it is still in an organized manner. To solve the problem of people having different intentions 
              we have integrated badges into our website and activities. These will show whether people are looking for a partner or just a friend. Per activity it will show the percentage of people with a pink or orange badge have already signed up. There will also be activities that are only for pink or orange badges. </p>
          <p class="font-italic font-weight-bold"> Unique value proposition   </p>
          <p>Our brand and product idea are different from other dating apps because people are able to sign up for the group activity instead of a specific person. You will meet people along the way while participating in a fun activity. Additionally, it is not just meant for dating. With our service people can meet a partner or new friend depending on what 
              they are looking for. Their intentions will be made clear using badges on the website and during the activities. This way it does not feel forced, but you will still meet people that have the same intentions as you do. </p>
          <p class="font-italic font-weight-bold"> Unfair advantage</p>
          <p>The aspects of our service that people cannot copy are the badges which are meant to show someone’s intention. Someone who is looking for a partner will have a pink badge and someone who is looking for a friend will have an orange badge. Furthermore, people choose the activity instead of the person. Whereas with a dating app people only look at 
              appearance and choose one single person to go on a date with. Additionally, during the activities there will be short ‘quests’ in which you will be encouraged to talk to one another and get to know them. </p>
          <p class="font-italic font-weight-bold"> Customer segments</p>
          <p>Our early adopters are middle-aged singles between 35 and 50 who feel lonely. Therefore, they do not want to be home often. They have a fulltime job which they devote their lives to and whenever they are not working, they busy themselves with activities like going to the gym. These people love their family and spend a lot of time with them but would 
              like to create their own family around them, whether this means meeting new friends or a partner.</p>
          <p class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Key metrics</p> 
          <p>We have interviewed 8 people for the solution interviews and all of them liked our service and said they would use it if it was available. Four of these people would want to get an additonal subscription on top of paying er aactivity. And four prefer to pay per activity.</p> 
          <p class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Service </p> 
          <p>Our brand wants to allow people to create meaningful connections, be their true self, feel empathy for each other, and make sure that everyone belongs. We would like to carry out these values with our service that allows people to sign up for group activities. On their account people should pick their badge. Which is either pink (looking for a partner) 
              or orange (looking for a friend). This way their intentions are clear, and it helps them find what they are looking for in a spontaneous way. There are activities in different price ranges. Taking a walk through the forest and doing a picknick, visiting the Rijksmuseum or skydiving for example. </p>

          <p> The variable costs for our service will be the activities and travel costs. For fixed costs we will have to pay wages and maintain the website. Example breakdown: </p>      
          <ul>
              <li>Bus driver wage: €16 per hour</li>
              <li>Event manager wage: €18 per hour </li>
              <li>Maintaining website: €65 per month</li>
              <li>Rijksmuseum trip: 22,50 per person + €5 travel costs + €7,50 tour guide = €35 per person</li>
              <li>€32 bus driver (2 hours) + €54 event manager (3 hours) = €86 in total</li>
              <li>(€35*10) + €26 = €436 total costs</li>
              <li>€64,99*10= €649,90 total turnover</li>
              <li>649,90-436 = €213,90 profit if we sell 10 tickets</li>
              <li>We ask our customers to pay €64,99 per person for this trip to the Rijksmuseum.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Channels</p>
          <p>We will use Facebook and Instagram to advertise our service because these are the platforms that are most used amongst middle-aged singles. The website will be the platform where people can sign up for the activities. </p>
          <p class="font-italic font-weight-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <p>People can pay per activity, but they can also decide to get a monthly subscription. By paying for a subscription people will get a small discount and have early access to sign up for activities.
              There will be activities in different price ranges. Low will be activities such as a walk through the forest and having a picnic. The middle range will be a trip to the Rijksmuseum for example and the high range may include activities like skydiving.
