          <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A colour scheme (with HTML colour codes, which must be consistent with your final website):
              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #0093F5;"></span>
                  #0093F5
                  <em>This light blue was used for navbar and footer to tie the whole page together, establishing it's borders in gentle way. This blue stands for sophistication and reliability.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #00406B;"></span>
                  #00406B
                  <em>This dark blue was used mainly for fonts - it is dark to create some contrast with the background and "highlight" information. This blue stands for corporate and high quality</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FEF8A6;"></span>
                  #FEF8A6
                  <em>This yellow was used for the background of the website, making it more saturated, evoking more positive thoughts. This yellow stands for happiness.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #FF91F9;"></span>
                  #FF91F9
                  <em>This hot pink was used for fonts - again trying to create some contast and make headers pop. This pink stands for sincerity and is flirty.</em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="font-weight-bold">Font choices</li>
            <li><p><strong>lust-serif</strong> -> used for main headers and navbar. We used a serif font to make it more playfull fitting our brand, 
                    most of the time complimenting contrast colors.
                </p></li>
            <li><p><strong>lust-dione-fine</strong> -> used for the brand name, differentiating a bit from other text. Close to previous font, but san serif, 
                    making it fell more professional and sophisticated, while still being on brand with the playful fell. 
                 </p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Raleway</strong> -> used for normal text and announcment, as it is easily readable, also thanks to the fact of being san serif. Used for plain text
                  </p></li>                  
           
            <li class="font-weight-bold">User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>Navigation bar</strong> -> used for a coherant navigation on top of the page. Also includes a dropdown menu for more options, while maitaining its simplicity.</li>
            <li><strong>Carousel</strong> -> used an owlcarousel which adds more features like auto scroll, hover pause and dynamic number of items. Used for rating and team presentation to make it more dynamic and engaging</li>
            <li><strong>Links</strong> -> used link internal on the page linking to other parts of the code/pages of the website and externaly to our social media, making eeverything more accesible.</li>
            <li><strong>Footer</strong> -> used on the bottom the page for some navigation to our social media, top of the page and copyright</li>
            <li><strong>Video container/iframe</strong> -> used on our landing/idex page to grab immediate attention, simply showing what our service is about. It has a transparent div overlaying it making it impossible to click.</li>
            <li><strong>Divs</strong> -> using divs which utilize flexbox to structure the page, making it responsive. Also overlaying the video as mentioned before.</li>
            <li><strong>Buttons</strong> -> using buttons which uses link to direct to content (mostly ouside of the page)</li>
            <li class="font-weight-bold">The structure of the navigation and content (e.g. how content units are distributed across pages)</li>
            <li><p> The whole page is structured with repetetive navbars and footers to make the controls same and not confusing. The navbar has 4 main
                    part, making it not overwhealming, when looking for something quickly. Other parts of the of the body use flexbox to be responsive.
                    Each part has some sort of visual design = picture, video or carousel with pictures to grab the attention of the user. This is complimented
                    by contrasting colors in headers. Links provide aditional navigation through the site, while also providing redirection to external content 
                    which is relevant to the brand/product.                 
                </p></li>
            <li>Please relate these elements to other units, for example:
              <ul>
                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>values and personality of the brand</strong>? Colors and visuals combined align with the values and personality of the brand</li>
                <li>How does website design fit the <strong>marketing and communication strategy</strong>? It provides a hub for people to explore our brand and product more in dept, communicating more information in depth.</li>
                <li>How does website design help showcase the <strong>unique value proposal of the product</strong>? The website has ddedicated page for the product which describes this unique proposal</li>

            <li>Your testing <strong>goals</strong> &ndash; in other words, what you are trying to learn about your website?</li>
            <li>Your testing <strong>methods</strong>, which includes information about:
              <ul>
                <li>The test&rsquo;s <strong>participants</strong> (number, match with target audience, etc.)
                <li>The test&rsquo;s <strong>setting</strong> (which material is used, is it done remotely, on campus, at home, etc.)

          <h4 id="limitations" class="mt-2 font-weight-bold">Limitations</h4>
          <p>Limitations I have found on the website:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Video on the main page does not play on a phone/tablet as youtube autoplay is dissabled on those devices -> possibly a javascript could be used to overcome this limitation. It would click on the location of the video after loading the page and playing the video?</li>
            <li>Video also shows the title of the video on initial load for small time frame.</li>
            <li>Not all the testing was done with our target audience. I understand that it is important for them to test the website, but unfortenately that was not possible thatnks to the limitation of time and humane resources.</li>
            <li>The colors could be sometimes too overwhealming for some people, also not fully accurately representing our values.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 id="purpose" class="mt-2 font-weight-bold">Purpose of the website</h4>
          <p>Purpose of this website is prelaunch website for our product</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p> Purpose of this website is prelaunch website for our product -> this is mainly true about the product page of the whole website. Rest 
                    is raise brand awarness. We felt that prelauch website would be better suited for our product, as founding tiers for
                    crowdfunding website do no really work for us as we have a service, not a product.
                </p></li>

          <p class="font-weight-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="font-italic font-weight-bold">List your top 3 problems you solve for your target group(s):</li>
            <li>Loneliness </li> 
            <li>Normal dates/dating apps feel forced </li>
            <li>People on dating apps often have different intentions </li>
            <li>Right now, these problems are mostly already separately solved by ‘normal’ (like tinder) dating apps and activity sign ups.  </li>
            <li>These problems were all uncovered in our problem interviews. Our interviewees said that they tried to keep themselves busy so that they would not feel so lonely. And that it was difficult to find someone at their age who had the same intentions as they did, since many people already have children or still really want to have children for example. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="font-weight-bold">Solution</p>

            <li>Sign up for group activities &rarr; do something fun together to solve the loneliness  </li>
            <li>Sign up for the activity instead of a specific person &rarr; does not make it feel forced </li>
            <li>You get a badge on your profile and during the activity stating your intentions &rarr; per activity it states how much percent of people with a specific badge have signed up already</li>

            <li><p> Our brand and product idea are different from other dating apps because people are able to sign up for the group activity instead of a specific person. 
                    You will meet people along the way while participating in a fun activity. This way it does not feel forced, but you will still meet people that have 
                    the same intentions as you do.</p>
